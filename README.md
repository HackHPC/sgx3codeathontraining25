# Session Resources
## Session 1: Kick-off 
The kickoff session for the coda-thon training event focused on building on participants' existing knowledge of Python and Jupiter notebooks, preparing them to represent the Science Gateway Center of Excellence team during the Acme code-a-thon. The team discussed their diverse programming languages, experiences with data processing, and the potential of implementing an AI-powered Science Gateway Assistant. They also agreed to use Discord for communication, Google Meet for meetings, and to focus on learning Unix and Linux for the upcoming week.
